3.3.1 What Did I Learn in this Module?

Other popular small mobile devices are smartwatches, fitness trackers, and virtual and augmented reality headsets. 
Mobile devices can use some of the same peripheral devices as laptops. Some mobile devices use a docking station to charge or use peripheral devices. Like laptops, mobile devices can feature several wireless technologies, including Bluetooth, Infrared, Wi-Fi, and the ability to access Cellular WANs. Some mobile devices can add more storage capacity by upgrading or adding more flash memory, such as MicroSD cards. 
At the end of the module, you learned the importance of a preventive maintenance program for mobile devices used in different environments. As a result, they are more likely than desktop computers to be exposed to harmful materials and situations, including dirt and contamination, spills, drops, excessive heat or cold, and excessive moisture.

How can I promote TVET in Nigeria without waiting on government?

#3 Arjun Prasad Tiwari from Nepal:
Dear Akaninyene Saturday,

I really like the interest you've generated on TVET and its promotion. I am also having the similar interest like yours as TVET is required to other general and other schools coming for a long in the communities, societies and the nations itself through out the globe.

I think it's quite hard to work with TVET promotion without aligning the government in the country however it doesn't mean that it is not possible to promote TVET without government. I think the ever first and foremost work for this is to listing the indigenous skills and occupations in your locality because we mostly work with existing skills and occupation primarily to promote the TVET. I am sure you have done with this already and ahead of this to go TVET promotion.

It would be nice to assist you with this as per my knowledge and capacity when you are sharing with your existing position. I can even confirm what capacity and competency I can align in the path of TVET promotion.

With regards,
Arjun
